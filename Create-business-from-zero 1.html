<h2>This strategy will help you create a consistent net profit income of $1,000-$19,000 monthly.</h2>
  <div align="center"><img src="Gallery/Faq.jpg" height="auto" width="100%" style="border-radius: 25px"/></div>
<p>Business is not big offices, thousand workers, brands, logos, websites, digital or physical commodities, services, e.t.c.</p>
<hr class='Dots'><h2>BUSINESS IS CASH IN!!!</h2><hr class='Dots'>
<h2>All you need is people to pay you!</h2>
<p>If you don't spend money, then you can't fail!</p>
<p>All you can get is profit in that way!</p>
<h2>Write all that you've got. We need the next things:</h2>
<h3>1) What do you have personally right now?</h3>
<p>a) physical things</p>
<p>b) your skills.</p>
<h3>2) What your parents have.</h3>
<p>a) Physical things.</p>
<p>b) Their skills.</p>
<h3>3) What your friends have.</h3>
<p>a) Physical things.</p>
<p>b) Their skills.</p>
<h3>4) What other people around you have.</h3>
<p>a) physical things.</p>
<p>b) Their skills.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
     <h2>Start your business.</h2>
     <hr class='Dots'>
<p>What do you have personally right now? Physical things. Even if it's renting, describe it too.</p>
<p>Take a paper sheet and write all things that you have. It should be literally everything like: laptop or PC, bicycle, space in your private or renting apartments, cars, motorcycles, underground parking space or a garage, e.t.c.</p>
<h3>All the examples you will see below are real cases of people from around the world.</h3>
<p>You can repeat each of them.</p>
<hr class='Dots'><h2>Case 1.</h2><hr class='Dots'>
<p>Let me tell you about the true case when a guy earned the first $105 after a couple hours and it was just the beginning.</p>
<p>His name is Tom, and it's his story.</p>
<p>One guy described it personally and has a one-room apartment.</p>
<p>He has a little fitting room and understands that this space is always empty.</p>
<p>What is going further, you already know, i guess.</p>
<p>He made a free ad in Craig's list and wrote, 'Store your winter tires for $35 per season.'</p>
<h2>Do you remember what business is? CASH IN.</h2>
<h2>Everything else is not business!</h2>
<p>What he got? 3 orders to storing tires during two hours!</p>
<p>He earned $105 from a total of zero!</p>
<p>Can you repeat this result? Easy if you want!</p>
   <hr class='Dots'><h2>Case 2.</h2><hr class='Dots'>
<p>The next guy and new case with renting things.</p>
<p>His name is James. He is still living in London.</p>
<p>He was renting a parking space for his car. It was an underground parking space with closing doors.</p>
<p>A bad time came for him, and he used my strategies.</p>
<p>As you know, a car doesn't take 100% of a garage space.</p>
<p>What else could we fit into a garage around a car??? That's right! Motorcycles!</p>
<p>He made a free ad and wrote, 'Store your motorcycles off season.'</p>
   <h2>Do you remember what business is? CASH IN.</h2>
   <h2>Everything else is not business!</h2>
<p>His renting space could fit 5 motorcycles, and he was earning £179 monthly from five owners in total. For people who don't know about off season, it is eight months every year in many countries.</p>
<p>He kept paying for renting space £78 monthly.</p>
<p>He was using his car every day as before.</p>
<p>Parking space for free +£101 net profit monthly in total.</p>
<p>Everybody is happy!</p>
<p>Motorcycle owners stored their private things in a safe place. James was earning cash IN.</p>
<p>Can you repeat this result?</p>
<p>Easy! Even if you don't have a garage, your friends do, or someone from a family does.</p>
<hr class='Dots'><h2>Case 3.</h2><hr class='Dots'>
<p>His name is George, and here's his story.</p>
<p>He urgently needed money, so he wrote off other people's skills that his younger brother and relatives had.</p>
<p>In the end, one of the skills his little brother had was driving a motorcycle.</p>
   <h2>Do you remember what business is? CASH IN.</h2>
   <h2>Everything else is not business!</h2>
<p>He advertised for people to teach them how to drive.</p>
<p>He charged $30 to $100 per lesson.</p>
<p>His brother rode his motorcycle teaching the clients, sharing 50% of the profits from each lesson with him.</p>
<p>Everybody's happy.</p>
      <hr class='Dots'><h2>Case 4.</h2><hr class='Dots'>
<p>Her name is Marie.<p>
<p>She has had a rough year, paying off her new car loans and other payments have taken her out of the flow.<p>
<p>She checked out everything she owns, including the loaned car, and a miracle happened.<p>
<p>The car she bought was a Mercedes A class.<p>
<p>She advertised on a free website for a photo shoot in front of her car for girls.<p>
<p>And what do you think?<p>
<p>There was no shortage of clients! Girls literally lined up to be photographed in the car for Instagram.<p>
<p>And since the car is VIP class, she charged a high price for one hour of photo shoot in return.<p>
<p>She paid off her car loan 1 year early just by using this method.<p>
<p>What is perfect about this method?<p>
<p>The mileage of the car does not increase; it stands still while the photos are taken.<p>
<p>Marie does not take the photos, they are taken by those who ordered the service themselves.<p>
<p>She would just drive to the location and then leave with the money from the customers.<p>
<p>What's funny is that she started earning more from this business than from her main job.<p>
    <hr class='Dots'><h2>Case 5.</h2><hr class='Dots'>
<p>At the time of this case study, Ben was 51 years old.
<p>Ben lives in France.</p>
<p>He wrote out his skills and realized that he perfectly knows all of Paris and the most hidden places in this city. If you have been to France, you know that this country. especially Paris is visited by a huge number of tourists.</p>
<p>He placed a free ad for guide services in Paris for the most unusual and exclusive places.</p>
<p>Gathering groups of people, he was a guide and, together with his grandson, showed tourists the sights of the city.</p>
<p>Then the grandson continued the business, giving 50% of the profit from each group to his grandfather Ben.</p>
<p>In 1 day, they started earning as much as they never made in 1 month at other jobs.</p>
<p>They are still running exclusive tours of Paris.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
<h2>These examples are more than enough to make you realize that money is literally all around you, all you need to do is just use the right strategies.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<h3>Why don't they teach this in institutes and colleges? It's not profitable for them.</h3>
<h3>By creating your own business, you become independent from the system, out of control, and this is exactly what all the states in the world are afraid of. Free and independent people are not profitable for them.</h3>
<p>You'd be surprised at how many things and skills you have right now, just until they make you money.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
   <h2>Some additional details about the business.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>When you smash the point and your offers start to CASH IN over $5,000, you can spend money using the next formula:</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
   <h2>1) If cash in less than $5,000, you don't spend money on your business.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>Until your offers earn less than this amount, don't spend money on websites, offices, workers, brand books, logos, e.t.c.</p>
<h3> Never spend more than 30% of your net profit for business! Never ever!</h3>
<h2>S = Total net profit - 30% max</h2>
<p>The main task for any business is to make you rich! Not set you in situations where you can risk, have loans, stress, or other things!</p>
<p>This is the reason why 99% of businesses failed! They spend more money than 30% at any level and even get loans that their business failed eventually. We are talking about spending money for growing businesses.</p>
<p>Let's imagine the horrible things if you spent 30% on something that doesn't work. What else? You still have the other 70% money! It's keeping you on wave for the for the next 2 months even if you don't earn anything!</p>
<p>If you break the rule and spend more than 30%, like 95% of money, what could happen next? You can lose it all and fail!</p>
<h2>Always follow the formula!</h2>
<h3>In fact, spending cash doesn't bring you more money!!!</h3>
<h3>What brings more money is the right strategy!!!</h3>
<hr class='Dots'><h2>2) Is it bringing more money?</h2><hr class='Dots'>
<h2>C = Money spent for growing business X multiplied CASH IN</h2>
<p>Any cent that you spend must bring you more CASH IN for your business.</p>
<p>The ideal result is that every dollar brings you more than double. For example, you spend $1 and immediately get CASH IN $2, $100, or $1,000,000.</p>
<p>Never spend money for your business if it doesn't bring you more cash in.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
<h2>How does money flow into your pockets?</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<h2>There are only five main ways to receive money.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
       <h2>1) Somebody pays money to you for results you can bring them.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>- Is not the best way because you are always limited in the time you can give for it.</p>
<p>- Working for someone even if you have a very high position is bad. At any minute, you can be fired from your position. For any company, especially corporations, you are just a small part in their mechanism that can be easily replaced.</p>
<p>- Working for someone you are limited in the level of income you receive.</p>
<p>- You are constantly dependent on your salary. If you stop working, you will have no money to draw from.</p>
<p>- The only example when it is profitable is if you are able to provide results that no one in the world can offer to clients except you.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
<h2>2) Other people work for you, and you get a % of the money that clients pay them.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>- This is how every company in the world works, including the biggest ones.</p>
<p>- Business owners don't stand in restaurants and serve customers, employees do.</p>
<hr class='Dots'> 
<h2>3) The system you created is earning you money.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>Examples such as Uber, Facebook, Word Lens, Wix, e.t.c.</p>
<p>What are the advantages of IT solutions?</p>
<p>The code of your website or app doesn't need to pay a salary, it doesn't get tired, it doesn't need a vacation, and it can deliver results to a billion customers at the same time, which no professional team of employees in the world can do.
<p>Who will send the fastest 100,000,000 emails?</p>
<p>A team of the most professional editors?</p>
<p>b) Code written once?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious: code will do it almost instantly, while humans will take years to do it.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many IT companies bring in so much money.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
    <h2>4) Investing. You invested $1 and got $2 or more for X period of time.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>Personally, I don't like this type because you don't control the incoming flow of money, you can only hope for results.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
      <h2>5) The most profitable way where you can get almost any amount of money. I only tell my clients.</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>Methods like inheritance and others we do not consider because you cannot control them.</p>
<h3>It doesn't matter who you are. You can earn any amount of money monthly.</h3>
<hr class='Dots'>
<h2>Meaningless things:</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>1) How old are you?</p>
<p>2) Do you have graduated or not?</p>
<p>3) Country and city you live in.</p>
<p>4) Do you have people you love or not?</p>
<p>5) Your gender.</p>
<p>6) Your family rich or not.</p>
<p>7) Do you have a personal PC or smartphone?</p>
<p>8) Someone believes in you or not.</p>
<p>9) Do you believe in yourself or not?</p>
<p>10) Amount of money you earn right now, even if it's zero, e.t.c.</p>
<hr class='Dots'><h2>THE ONLY THING THAT BRINGS YOU RESULTS IN BUSINESS IS THE RIGHT PHYSICAL ACTIONS!</h2><hr class='Dots'>
<p>Right now I prove it for you!</p>
<p>Let's make a simple experiment.</p>
<p>Right now grab something from your table and lift it on 10 cm and put it back.</p>
<p>Now make the same thing but start to not believe in yourself.</p>
<p>I already see your smile!</p>
<h2>In both ways, you get the same result!</h2>
<p>This is one of the key things you have to learn.</p>
<h2>If you make the right physical actions, you always get results!</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<h2>What is the perfect business?</h2>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>It's very simple.</p>
<h3>1) Making $1,000,000,000 or more each month.</h3>
<p>Any business is about making money in unlimited quantities.</p>
<h3>2) We spent $0 to get this result.</h3>
<p>At the same time, the results our clients get should remain the same or improve.</p>
<p>These are the two key metrics that every company in the world strives for. From the hot dog vendor on the street making $150 a day to multi-billion-dollar corporations.</p>
<h2>These are the core of any business plan.</h2>
<p>Your company will start to fail as soon as you start ignoring these points.</p>
<p>Analyze, for the sake of interest, the fall of the biggest brands, and you will see that the cause was always the one I described.</p>
<p>Will these strategies help you create a multi-million-dollar corporation? No.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>To do this, you need to utilize other strategies, like:
<hr class='Dots'>
<h3>1) Knowing how to develop results for clients that no one else in the market has provided before you. Including creating digital or physical products or new services.</h3>
<h3>2) Know strategies for creating multi-level sources of net profit.</h3>
<h3>3) Know strategies for developing business models that disrupt decades-old established markets.</h3>
<h3>4) Know how to reduce costs without sacrificing the quality of the results delivered to clients.</h3>
<h3>5) Understand the algorithm for creating successful businesses in any category.</h3>
<h2>Know how to bring companies to the position of market leaders and much more.</h2>
<p>There are also simple strategies for creating multi-million dollar corporations where you achieve results step by step without investing money, but this is the content of my other materials.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>My personal company has been a market leader in 11 countries since 2015.</p>
<p>Five of my clients' companies made it to the Forbes list thanks to the strategies I developed for them.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, my clients have increased their net profits by over $170,000,000,000 with my help.</p>
<p>I have over 15,000,031 email subscribers who have signed up for my newsletter. I have never advertised or used social media to get this result.</p>
<hr class='Dots'>
<p>Implement the strategies and start earning.</p>
